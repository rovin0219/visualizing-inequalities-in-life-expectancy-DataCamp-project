# visualizing-inequalities-in-life-expectancy-DataCamp-project

## Project Description

#### In this DataCamp project, we will compare the life expectancy across countries and genders by manipulating and visualizing United Nations data using ggplot2.

#### By the end of the project, we will be able to answer the following questions:
#### Do women live longer than men? How long?
#### Does it happen everywhere?
#### Is life expectancy increasing? Everywhere?
#### Which is the country with the lowest life expectancy? Which is the one with the highest?
